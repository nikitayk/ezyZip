# ZeroTrace Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** January 2025  
**Version:** 1.0.0

## üõ°Ô∏è Our Commitment to Privacy

ZeroTrace is built on the fundamental principle that your learning journey and personal data should remain completely private. We believe privacy is not a feature‚Äîit's a fundamental right. This policy explains how we protect your data and what you can expect from us.

## üîí Privacy-First Architecture

### Local-Only Processing
- **All data processing happens on your device** - nothing is sent to external servers unless you explicitly provide an API key
- **Zero data collection** - we don't track, analyze, or store your usage patterns
- **Offline functionality** - core features work completely without internet connection

### Encryption & Security
- **PIN-protected encryption** - all gamification data is encrypted with AES-256 using your personal PIN
- **Local storage only** - data is stored in your browser's secure storage, never transmitted
- **No backdoors** - we cannot access your encrypted data, even if requested

## üìä What Data We Handle

### Data We Store Locally
- **Gamification Progress**: Achievements, streaks, problem-solving history, experience points
- **User Preferences**: Settings, theme choices, language preferences
- **API Keys** (if provided): Encrypted and stored locally only
- **Problem Sessions**: Your DSA problem-solving attempts and results

### Data We Never Collect
- **Personal Information**: Name, email, phone number, or any identifying details
- **Usage Analytics**: How you use the extension, which features you access
- **Problem Content**: The actual problems you solve or code you write
- **Network Activity**: Websites you visit or content you browse

## üåê Outbound Requests

### Default Behavior
- **Zero outbound requests** by default
- **No tracking pixels** or analytics calls
- **No telemetry** or usage reporting

### When Requests Are Made
- **User-initiated only** - requests only happen when you explicitly use AI features
- **API mode only** - requires you to provide your own API keys
- **Transparent logging** - all outbound requests are logged and visible to you

### Request Transparency
- **Real-time logging** - see every network request in the privacy dashboard
- **Request details** - method, URL, timestamp, and purpose are logged
- **User control** - you can disable API features at any time

## üîë API Key Management

### Your Keys, Your Control
- **Local storage only** - API keys are encrypted and stored on your device
- **Never transmitted to us** - we never see, store, or access your API keys
