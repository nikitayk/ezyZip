- **Risk Level**: High

#### 7. Browser Extension Vulnerabilities
- **Threat**: Chrome extension platform security flaws
- **Impact**: Potential privilege escalation, data access
- **Mitigation**: Regular security updates, minimal permissions
- **Risk Level**: High

#### 8. Physical Device Compromise
- **Threat**: Attacker with physical access to user's device
- **Impact**: Complete data access, PIN bypass
- **Mitigation**: Device-level security, encryption at rest
- **Risk Level**: High

## üõ°Ô∏è Mitigation Strategies

### 1. Data Encryption
- **AES-256-GCM** encryption for all sensitive data

- **15-minute timeout** for lockout periods
- **Session management** with automatic logout

### 3. Network Security
- **Zero outbound requests** by default
- **Direct API communication** (no proxy servers)
- **Request logging** for transparency
- **User-initiated only** network activity

### 4. Code Security
- **Content Security Policy** (CSP) implementation
- **Sandboxed execution** environment
- **Input validation** and sanitization
- **Regular security audits** and updates

### 5. Privacy Controls
- **Local-only processing** by default
- **Transparent logging** of all activities
- **User consent** for any data sharing
- **Data portability** and export controls
